# SightSpeech / Sight-to-Speech

**A React app that reads words aloud from a camera feed, controlled by hand gestures from legally blind users.**  
Based on MediaPipe, OCR, and custom gesture detection, this tool empowers visually impaired users to access visual text in their environment.  

---

## Features

- Real-time camera capture and processing  
- Hand gesture recognition (e.g. “point left”, “O”, open palm)  
- OCR (text recognition) on camera frames  
- Text-to-speech output to read recognized words aloud  
- Lightweight fallback and buffering to avoid flicker errors

## 🏗 Architecture & Components

| Component | Responsibility |
|----------|-----------------|
| **Frontend (React / Next.js / “use client”)** | Captures video, draws landmarks, sends gestures |
| **Gesture Recognizer (MediaPipe Tasks–Vision)** | Detects hand landmarks & base gesture categories |
| **Custom Gesture Overrides** | Rules-based detection for “O”, “point left”, etc. |
| **Stable Gesture Buffering** | Avoids flicker by requiring consistent predictions |
| **Keypress Simulation** | Emits synthetic key events mapped to gestures |
| **Backend / OCR / TTS (Flask or similar)** | Processes camera frames, runs OCR, reads text aloud |

## 🖐 Gesture Mapping (Default)

| Gesture         | Description / Use |
| --------------- | ----------------- |
| `Open_Palm`     | Start             |
| `Closed_Fist`   | Description       |
| `Pointing_Up`   | Tab               |
| `Pointing_Left` | Backwards Tab     |

You can adjust these mappings in the React `useEffect` that handles `stableGesture`.
